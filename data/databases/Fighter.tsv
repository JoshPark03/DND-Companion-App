Class	Subclass	Feature	Level	Description
Fighter	Base	Fighting Style	1	You adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery: You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Blind Fighting: You have blindsight with a range of 10 feet. Within that range, you can effectively see anything that isn't behind total cover, even if you're blinded or in darkness. You can also see an invisible creature within that range, unless the creature successfully hides from you. Defense: While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling: When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Great Weapon Fighting: When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack with a melee weapon you're wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if it's a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit. Interception: When a creature you can see hits a target, other than you, within 5 feet of you with an attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage the target takes by 1d10 + your proficiency bonus (minimum of 0 damage). You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction. Protection: When a creature you can see attacks a target other than you within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield. Superior Technique: You learn one maneuver of your choice from those available to the Battle Master archetype. If a maneuver requires your target to make a saving throw, the DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice). You gain one superiority die, which is a d6 (added to any superiority dice from another source). This die fuels your maneuvers and is expended when used. You regain expended superiority dice after a short or long rest. Thrown Weapon Fighting: You can draw a weapon with the thrown property as part of the attack you make with it. Additionally, when you hit with a ranged attack using a thrown weapon, you gain a +2 bonus to the damage roll. Two-Weapon Fighting: When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Unarmed Fighting: Your unarmed strikes can deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier on a hit. If you're not wielding any weapons or a shield when you make the attack roll, the d6 becomes a d8. At the start of each of your turns, you can deal 1d4 bludgeoning damage to one creature grappled by you.

You gain an additional superiority die at 7th level and another at 15th level. Saving Throws: Some maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects.

Cantrips: You learn two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. You learn an additional wizard cantrip of your choice at 10th level. Spell Slots: The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your wizard spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell Shield and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast Shield using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: You know three 1st-level wizard spells of your choice, two of which you must choose from the abjuration and evocation spells on the wizard spell list. The Spells Known column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows when you learn more wizard spells of 1st level or higher. Each of these spells must be an abjuration or evocation spell of your choice and must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 7th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. The spells you learn at 8th, 14th, and 20th level can come from any school of magic. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the wizard spells you know with another spell of your choice from the wizard spell list. The new spell must be of a level for which you have spell slots, and it must be an abjuration or evocation spell, unless you're replacing the spell you gained at 3rd, 8th, 14th, or 20th level from any school of magic. Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, as you learn your spells through study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. Additionally, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier; Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier.
Fighter	Eldritch Knight	Weapon Bond	3	At 3rd level, you learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can't be disarmed of that weapon unless you are incapacitated. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a bonus action on your turn, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand. You can have up to two bonded weapons, but can summon only one at a time with your bonus action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
