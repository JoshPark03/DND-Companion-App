Class	Subclass	Feature	Level	Description
Warlock	Base	Pact Magic	1	Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells. Cantrips: You know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table. Spell Slots: The Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your warlock spells of 1st through 5th level, and all your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest. For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell witch bolt, you must spend one of those slots, casting it as a 3rd-level spell. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher: At 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list. The Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level or higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what's shown in the Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability: Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. You also use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier; Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier. Spellcasting Focus: You can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.
Warlock	Base	Eldritch Invocations	2	In your study of occult lore, you have unearthed Eldritch Invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability. At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.
Warlock	Base	Pact Boon	3	At 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice. Pact of the Blade: You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand, choosing its form each time. You are proficient with it while wielding it, and it counts as magical for overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage. Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more, if you use this feature again, if you dismiss it (no action required), or if you die. You can transform a magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a 1-hour ritual while holding it, even during a short rest. Once transformed, it appears whenever you create your pact weapon and can be dismissed into an extradimensional space. You can't use this ritual on an artifact or a sentient weapon, and if the bond breaks, the weapon appears at your feet. Pact of the Chain: You learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual without it counting against your spells known. When casting, you can choose an imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite as a familiar. When you take the Attack action, you can forgo one attack to let your familiar use its reaction to attack. Pact of the Tome: Your patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. Choose three cantrips from any class's spell list (the three needn't be from the same list). While you have the book, you can cast these cantrips at will. They donâ€™t count against your cantrips known, and they are warlock spells for you even if not on the warlock spell list. If you lose the book, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony during a short or long rest to receive a replacement from your patron. The previous book is destroyed, and the book turns to ash when you die. Pact of the Talisman: Your patron gives you an amulet, or talisman, that aids the wearer in times of need. When the wearer fails an ability check, they can add a d4 to the roll, potentially turning the result into a success. This benefit can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, with all uses restored after a long rest. If you lose the talisman, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement during a short or long rest. The previous talisman is destroyed, and it turns to ash when you die.
Warlock	Base	Ability Score Improvement	4	When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.
Warlock	Base	Mystic Arcanum	11	At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again. At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.
Warlock	Base	Eldritch Master	20	At 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.

Archfey Expanded Spells: 1st level: Faerie Fire, Sleep; 2nd level: Calm Emotions, Phantasmal Force; 3rd level: Blink, Plant Growth; 4th level: Dominate Beast, Greater Invisibility; 5th level: Dominate Person, Seeming.
Warlock	Archfey	Fey Presence	1	Starting at 1st level, your patron bestows upon you the ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey. As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightened by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Warlock	Archfey	Misty Escape	6	Starting at 6th level, you can vanish in a puff of mist in response to harm. When you take damage, you can use your reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Warlock	Archfey	Beguiling Defense	10	Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them. You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature. The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.
Warlock	Archfey	Dark Delirium	14	Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm. As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC. On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell). This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage. Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose. The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion. You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.

Warlock	Fiend	Dark One's Own Luck	6	Starting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll's effects occur. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Warlock	Fiend	Fiendish Resilience	10	Starting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.
Warlock	Fiend	Hurl Through Hell	14	Starting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape. At the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
Warlock	Great Old One	Expanded Spell List	1	The Great Old One lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.

Warlock	Great Old One	Awakened Mind	1	Starting at 1st level, your alien knowledge gives you the ability to touch the minds of other creatures. You can telepathically speak to any creature you can see within 30 feet of you. You don't need to share a language with the creature for it to understand your telepathic utterances, but the creature must be able to understand at least one language.
Warlock	Great Old One	Entropic Ward	6	At 6th level, you learn to magically ward yourself against attack and to turn an enemy's failed strike into good luck for yourself. When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that roll. If the attack misses you, your next attack roll against the creature has advantage if you make it before the end of your next turn. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
Warlock	Great Old One	Thought Shield	10	Starting at 10th level, your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You also have resistance to psychic damage, and whenever a creature deals psychic damage to you, that creature takes the same amount of damage that you do.
Warlock	Great Old One	Create Thrall	14	At 14th level, you gain the ability to infect a humanoid's mind with the alien magic of your patron. You can use your action to touch an incapacitated humanoid. That creature is then charmed by you until a Remove Curse spell is cast on it, the charmed condition is removed from it, or you use this feature again. You can communicate telepathically with the charmed creature as long as the two of you are on the same plane of existence.
